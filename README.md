# 🛍️ Myntra Functional Clone

A **functional front-end clone** of the popular e-commerce platform **Myntra**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates dynamic cart management — users can **add products to their bag**, **view selected items**, **remove products**, and **see a live cart summary** with total price updates in real-time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users browse products listed on the homepage.  
2. On clicking **Add to Bag**, product data is stored in a JavaScript array (cart state).  
3. The **Bag page** displays selected items dynamically from that array.  
4. Removing an item updates the state and recalculates the total amount.
