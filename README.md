## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates essential e-commerce functionality using front-end logic only.  
Data for products is loaded from a JavaScript file (`items.js`), and user actions are handled using DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic functionality and DOM manipulation

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users browse products listed on the homepage.  
2. On clicking **Add to Bag**, product data is stored in a JavaScript array (cart state).  
3. The **Bag page** displays selected items dynamically from that array.  
4. Removing an item updates the state and recalculates the total amount.

- 🧮 Add quantity selector and product filters  
- 💳 Implement checkout and payment simulation page
